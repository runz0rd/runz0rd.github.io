      <description>Introductions My name is Miloš Pejanović and I work as a programmer. Most of the time that work is regarding web services, but sometimes I get lucky and work on (internal) tooling and kubernetes. I live and work in Novi Sad, Serbia. This blog is my way of documenting how I waste my free time (with tech).
Personal info Im a simple guy (not according to others). I enjoy (dis)assembling software, FOSS (in every way), gunpla (ガンプラ), and watching movies, shows and anime.</description>

      <description>Why I wanted an easy way to control my macbookpro from my desktop setup.
What I found was a lot of proprietary options and a couple of open sourced ones that were okay, but always lacking some little thing that would annoy the hell out of me. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a cheap bastard and love open source I opted for the latter with modifications. Most vnc options were extremely slow, so I &amp;ldquo;vnced&amp;rdquo; my keyboard and mouse only (x2vnc), and connected the macbookpro to my monitor input.</description>
