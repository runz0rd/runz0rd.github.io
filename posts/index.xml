      <description>Why I wanted an easy way to control my macbookpro from my desktop setup.
What I found was a lot of proprietary options and a couple of open sourced ones that were okay, but always lacking some little thing that would annoy the hell out of me. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a cheap bastard and love open source I opted for the latter with modifications. Most vnc options were extremely slow, so I &amp;ldquo;vnced&amp;rdquo; my keyboard and mouse only (x2vnc), and connected the macbookpro to my monitor input.</description>
